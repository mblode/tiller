// Served at /tiller/robots.txt via basePath. Crawlers only read robots.txt
// from a host root, so blode.co/robots.txt governs the proxied path; this file is
// what tiller.blode.co resolves to, since that subdomain 308s to
// blode.co/tiller and both Google and Search Console follow the redirect.
//
// AI-open on purpose: crawl, index, ground and train are all permitted, so a
// single `*` group states the whole policy. No `Content-Signal:` line: signals
// are a reservation mechanism, so silence already means no restriction is
// expressed, and an all-yes signal only adds an unknown-directive warning in
// Search Console.
//
// No `Sitemap:` line: this zone does not publish one.
